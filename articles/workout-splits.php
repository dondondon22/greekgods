            <h2>What is Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)?</h2>
            <p>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) refers to the minimum amount of energy, measured in calories, that the human body requires to maintain vital physiological functions at rest, such as breathing, circulation, and cellular processes. This energy expenditure is critical to sustaining life, even when an individual is not engaged in physical activity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="main-container">
            <div class="main-info">
                <h3>Why is BMR Important?</h3>
                <p>BMR plays a foundational role in understanding an individual's overall energy needs. It forms the largest component of Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), which combines BMR with energy burned through physical activity and food digestion. Recognizing one’s BMR allows for precise adjustments in caloric intake, which is crucial for achieving health and fitness goals, such as weight management, muscle gain, or general well-being.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>For Weight Loss:</strong> A caloric deficit—consuming fewer calories than one’s TDEE—can result in weight loss. Knowing BMR ensures this deficit is calculated correctly without compromising basic bodily functions.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Weight Gain:</strong> Conversely, a caloric surplus—eating more than TDEE—can aid in muscle growth or weight gain, particularly when paired with resistance training.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Maintenance:</strong> To maintain weight, caloric intake should align with TDEE, factoring in BMR and other energy expenditures.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="main-info">
                <h3>How is BMR Calculated?</h3>
                <p>The calculation of BMR depends on individual factors such as age, gender, weight, and height, as well as lean body mass. Two widely recognized methods for estimating BMR are the Harris-Benedict Equation and the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation, with the latter being preferred for its improved accuracy in modern populations.</p>
                <p><strong>Mifflin-St Jeor Equation</strong></p>
                <p><strong>For Men:</strong></p>
                <p>BMR = 10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) - 5 × age (years) + 5</p>
                <p><strong>For Women:</strong></p>
                <p>BMR = 10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) - 5 × age (years) - 161</p>            
                <p>Example Calculation</p>
                <p>Consider a 30-year-old woman weighing 60 kg and measuring 165 cm tall. Her BMR is calculated as follows:</p>
                <p>BMR = (10 × 60) + (6.25 × 165) - (5 × 30) - 161 = 1320.25 calories/day</p>

            <div class="main-info">
                <h3>Factors That Influence BMR</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Age:</strong> BMR decreases with age due to a decline in lean muscle mass and changes in hormonal activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Men generally exhibit a higher BMR than women, primarily because they tend to have more lean muscle tissue, which burns more calories than fat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Body Composition:</strong> Individuals with a higher proportion of muscle mass experience an elevated BMR compared to those with greater fat mass.</li>
                    <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Genetic predispositions can influence metabolic efficiency, impacting BMR independently of lifestyle factors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Health Conditions:</strong> Diseases, thyroid dysfunction, and hormonal imbalances can either elevate or suppress BMR.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        
            <div class="main-info">
                <h3>BMR and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)</h3>
                <p>While BMR reflects the calories needed for vital functions, Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) includes additional energy spent on activities and food metabolism. TDEE is calculated by multiplying BMR with an activity factor, which accounts for lifestyle and exercise habits, ranging from sedentary to very active.</p>

            <div class="main-info">
                <h3>Strategies to Improve BMR</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Increase Muscle Mass:</strong> Strength training builds muscle, which burns more calories at rest than fat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay Active:</strong> Engaging in regular exercise, including aerobic and anaerobic activities, enhances metabolic rate over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consume Adequate Protein:</strong> A high-protein diet supports muscle maintenance and increases the thermic effect of food (TEF), leading to higher calorie expenditure during digestion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Extreme Dieting:</strong> Severely restricting calories can trigger metabolic adaptations, reducing BMR as the body conserves energy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is a fundamental measure of how the body utilizes energy to maintain life-sustaining processes. By understanding BMR, individuals can tailor their caloric intake and activity levels to achieve specific health goals. Whether for weight loss, maintenance, or muscle gain, incorporating BMR into one’s fitness strategy provides a scientific foundation for success.</p>
